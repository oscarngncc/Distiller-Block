# Distiller-Block

----
## What is Distiller_Block ?
Distiller_Block is a Rainmeter skin that is used to accompany with Windows Autohide-Taskbar feature. It allows users to view all the running applications and useful data within a smaller display windows, with their taskbar hidden. This allows users to have more real-screen estate, without the compromise of incapability to see any useful information within a glance.

## ToDo List
* Making the setting file more polished with more themes and display options
* At this moment,all Windows built-in windows and Windows Universal Platform Apps in Windows 10 cannot be displayed properly like typical software does. While it does successfully count total numbers of these kind of applications, hopefully there is a better way to retieve the process and icon
* Making the software more user-friendly towards users that want to create their own themes
* Performance and Optimization
